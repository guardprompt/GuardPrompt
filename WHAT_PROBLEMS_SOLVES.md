# What Problems GuardPrompt Solves
GuardPrompt is built to address real, recurring challenges inside organizations that handle sensitive information, large volumes of documents, and strict compliance requirements. This document outlines the practical problems GuardPrompt solves and the value it delivers.

---

## 1. Sensitive information cannot be safely sent to cloud AI
Organizations work with personal data, contracts, procedures, HR files, logs, internal reports, and regulatory documents.  
Sending such content to cloud LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) creates compliance risks.

**GuardPrompt solves this by:**
- processing original documents locally,
- anonymizing sensitive data using an on-prem LLM,
- ensuring that only *de-identified* text may be used externally (if the organization chooses to).

This enables safe AI adoption under GDPR, NIS2, and internal security policies.

---

## 2. Need for consistent, automated anonymization of documents
Manual anonymization is:
- slow,
- inconsistent,
- error-prone,
- expensive.

**GuardPrompt provides local LLM-powered anonymization** that removes:
- names, addresses, identifiers,
- roles, contacts, numbers,
- sensitive text fragments.

Anonymization happens before any external use.

---

## 3. Employees struggle to find information across many internal documents
Knowledge is buried in:
- PDFs,
- scanned files,
- Word documents,
- SharePoint,
- email attachments,
- intranet portals.

Employees lose hours searching or re-reading documents.

**GuardPrompt turns all documents into a searchable AI knowledge base** powered by semantic RAG.

---

## 4. There is no internal AI assistant trained on the organization's documents
Cloud AI agents cannot access internal files (or are unsafe to do so).

**GuardPrompt provides a private AI assistant** that:
- answers questions based on internal documents,
- explains rules, policies, and procedures,
- summarizes long documents,
- compares different versions,
- extracts key points and obligations.

This boosts productivity and decision-making.

---

## 5. High cost of individual AI subscriptions (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
Purchasing a subscription for each employee quickly becomes expensive.

**GuardPrompt replaces dozens or hundreds of subscriptions with one internal AI engine**, resulting in significantly lower cost per employee with unlimited usage.

---

## 6. Organizations need full control over their AI infrastructure
Cloud AI tools do not provide:
- control over data storage,
- control over access,
- auditability,
- ability to run offline,
- reproducible behavior.

GuardPrompt is fully on-premise:
- no telemetry,
- no external API calls,
- works in air-gapped environments,
- complete audit and governance.

---

## 7. Reduces knowledge bottlenecks (“ask the expert” problem)
Many processes depend on a few key experts.  
When they are away, workflows slow down.

**GuardPrompt democratizes access to knowledge**, ensuring consistent answers without overloading specialists.

---

## 8. Faster onboarding and training of new employees
New employees struggle to find relevant documents and understand processes.

With GuardPrompt they can ask:
- “How do we handle incident reporting?”
- “What is the procurement process?”
- “Explain the difference between versions of this policy.”

Onboarding time decreases significantly.

---

## 9. Ensures consistent answers across the organization
Without a central knowledge engine:
- each person interprets rules differently,
- outdated versions circulate,
- misunderstandings create risk.

GuardPrompt always answers using **official, indexed documents**, ensuring consistency.

---

## 10. Decreases mistakes in critical processes
Mistakes often occur when:
- people use outdated versions of procedures,
- employees miss important clauses,
- instructions are unclear.

GuardPrompt makes relevant rules explicit and easy to verify.

---

## 11. Enables full-text search inside scanned PDFs and legacy documents
Traditional search fails on:
- scanned PDFs,
- poor OCR files,
- tabular data,
- multi-page mixes of text and images.

GuardPrompt reconstructs text through modern OCR and parsing, making archives searchable.

---

## 12. Eliminates manual comparison of document versions
Changing policies and procedures require careful reading.

GuardPrompt can answer:
- “What changed since version 2.1?”
- “Summarize differences between two documents.”

Saving hours of manual work for auditors, legal teams, and compliance departments.

---

## 13. Improves communication between departments
Information silos cause delays and misunderstandings.

GuardPrompt provides a **single unified knowledge base**, reducing friction between teams.

---

## 14. Reduces repetitive questions to senior staff
Experts often receive the same questions repeatedly.

GuardPrompt handles these queries, freeing senior employees for higher-value tasks.

---

## 15. Works offline (air-gapped environments)
Essential for:
- government institutions,
- defense and law enforcement,
- critical infrastructure,
- sensitive IT systems.

GuardPrompt requires no internet connection.

---

## 16. Facilitates audit and regulatory responses
Auditors often need to locate specific requirements quickly.

GuardPrompt allows instant semantic search across thousands of documents.

---

## 17. Future-proof and integrable
Because the system is modular, it can integrate with:
- SharePoint,
- Confluence,
- document management systems,
- local directories,
- future AI models.

This makes GuardPrompt adaptable to evolving needs.
