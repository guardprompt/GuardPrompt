# GuardPrompt  
### Private AI for Document Understanding  
**Secure. Local. Efficient.**

GuardPrompt is an **on-premise AI platform** for organizations that handle sensitive documents and require fully local processing.  
It performs document parsing, OCR, semantic search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — all **without sending data to the cloud**.

---

## Why GuardPrompt Exists

Organizations produce thousands of documents: PDFs, scanned pages, internal policies, legal texts, emails, reports.  
Finding the right information becomes slow, manual, and expensive.

Cloud AI tools are powerful, but often **cannot be used** because of:

- GDPR restrictions  
- NIS2 and national cybersecurity requirements  
- classified or confidential information  
- internal security policies  
- data sovereignty concerns  

**GuardPrompt closes this gap** by delivering modern AI capabilities *inside your own environment*.

---

## Who Should Use GuardPrompt?

GuardPrompt is ideal for:

### Government & Public Sector
- ministries, registries, regulators  
- agencies processing personal or confidential data  
- organizations with restricted networks or air-gapped systems  

### Enterprise & Regulated Industries
- finance, banking, insurance  
- legal departments  
- healthcare & clinical institutions  
- internal audit, compliance & security teams  

### Any organization that:
- handles sensitive documents  
- cannot upload data to external AI services  
- needs fast access to internal knowledge
